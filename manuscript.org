* Interpretations
- Friday is when patients move from daycare to main OR which
may be a source of delay.
- Segregate first cases from non-first cases

* Results

Mean/median of first case delay and off hour

Distribution of first case start time (ST1) (incision time - patient arrived time),
    - subgroup analysis per surgery
    - recommendations of possible valid start times
        - "valid" means not unfair to disqualify the surgeon and not causing
          monetary loss to the OR
        - read about the preparations of that surgery
            - make recommendations for standardization thereof
            - make hypothetical BPMN diagram
            - highlight opportunities for standardization of quality control

Normalized bar chart of the different times as a percentage of first case start
time

Cases categorized as delays and non-delays if using current first cases
definition and then using our definition (which includes time to incision)

* Discussion
Surgery is of value to the patient and everything else that we do is either for
the patient's comfort and potentially puts at risk

We can minimize activities other than the surgery itself by strict process
control.

Reliably repeatable process
control flow diagram
different colors for each department that's involved in each process


- make arguments of which delay is more informative: ORINTAKE or TIME TO
  INCISION as a measure of first case delay

- recommendations of possible valid start times
  - "valid" means not unfair to disqualify the surgeon and not causing
    monetary loss to the OR
  - read about the preparations of that surgery
    - make recommendations for standardization thereof
    - make hypothetical BPMN diagram
    - highlight opportunities for standardization of quality control
      - opportunities for automated data entry
      - real-time dashboard

causes of first case delays
